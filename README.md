This library handles the basic application environment for a
[PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) in the **Shopgate Cloud**.

It holds everything that is needed for data storage via [Redux](http://redux.js.org),
observable streams via [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs), and it serves with a variety of
pre-defined Redux actions, reselect selectors and RxJS streams and subscriptions.

It also provides you a variety of ready to go React Components that you can use inside your
Shopgate Cloud PWA theme.
