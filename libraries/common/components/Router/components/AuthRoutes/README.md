# AuthRoutes
---

With the AuthRoutes component you can protect routes from being 
opened if the user is not logged in. In this case the user will first be redirected 
to the login page and then forwarded to the actual route after the login was successful. 
If the user is already logged in, the final route will directly show up.

> **Dependents:** <br> `<Route />`

## Getting Started

```
import React from 'react';
import { Route, AuthRoutes } from 'Library/components';

const Routes = () =>
  <App>
    <Route
      path={`${INDEX_PATH}`}
      component="Page"
    />
    <Route
    <AuthRoutes to={`${LOGIN_PATH}`}>
      <Route
        path={`${CHECKOUT_PATH}`}
        component="checkout"
      />
    </AuthRoutes>
  </App>
;
```
