This library contains commerce modules for a shopping
[PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) in the **Shopgate Cloud**.

It contains everything necessary for the redux data storage to deal with products, categories,
search results, filters, orders, the cart and the checkout.

## Installation

```
npm i @shopgate/pwa-common-commerce --save
```

[@shopgate/pwa-core](https://github.com/shopgate/pwa-core) and the
[@shopgate/pwa-common](https://github.com/shopgate/pwa-core) into your project. If you are not
planing to work on these as well, you don't need to install them separately inside your theme.
